Creating a habit tracker that allows you to track new goals for 30 days easily from a web page. You can reset, add new, alter, and earn points for your habit tracking.


### Features

- Ability to detail new goals on a rolling 30 day basis
  -Ex. Read for 30 minutes a day, Wake up at 5 am, Midday walk
- App sets up 30 days of check boxes that you can return to day after day until your 30 days
- If you miss a day, a pop up gives some encouragement (I think I saw an API for this)
